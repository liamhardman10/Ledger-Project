# Ledger Project
This repository contains HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

# Description
I created this webpage because one of my college teammates was recording his profits/losses from bowling on a google sheet. 
I thought it would be cool to make my own iteration of that and created this ledger-like project!

# Functionality
There are 4 different pages the user can visit, including the homepage.

**Expenses:** This page allows the user to record the name of the expense, the amount of the expense, and the date.
**Profits:** This page allows the user to record the name of the profit, the amount of the profit, and the date.
***WIP*** **Lifetime Chart** This page will allow the user to see their full transaction log.
